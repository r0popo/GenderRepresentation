## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This project is focused on analysing the demographic aspect of the survey, specifically the gender representation and some of the main distinction areas between genders within the coding realm.

Three key questions this project focuses on are:
1. What is the profile of gender representation in 2021 and are there any identifiable trends when compared to the surveys from the 2017-2021 period?
2. Is the engagement of different genders in various coding-related communities the same of does it vary?
3. Do different genders develop interest in coding at the same age or is there a noticeable difference?

## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>
The available notebook showcases work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to add context and outline the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@ropopo/why-sexist-ai-comes-as-no-surprise-57d630a5381f).
